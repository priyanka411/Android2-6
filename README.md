### Priyanka Bonam
     * Database handler- created a database to store the user login details, predefined vendor login details, and user comments, and food center details.
     * Also, design interface to let user give comments along with rating
     * For security purpose designed the app in a way that Vendors login details should match with the food center selection in dropdownlist in firstactivity(Example if you select mooyah in dropdownlist, and want to login as a vendor you can only login with mooyah credentials)
     * Added logout functionality
